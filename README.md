Modules for performing analysis on MD trajectories for the VirMelt project.

This repo is devoted to 1) writing and testing function for creating descriptors from MD trajectories and 2) training machine learning models on those descriptors to predict protein thermal stability. 

This is based on the work from the [AbMelt](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006349524003850) paper by Rollins et al.
